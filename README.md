# MongooseBasics
Learning how to work with mongoDB through Mongoose which is a JavaScript object-oriented programming library that creates a connection between a MongoDB and the Node.js JavaScript runtime environment.

In this example I learned how to set up a connection url, avoid the parser error, create a schemas, create objects to store in schemas, how to save objects, and how to insert a bulk amount of objects at once through an array parameter and callback function that checks for errors first before notifying for success.
